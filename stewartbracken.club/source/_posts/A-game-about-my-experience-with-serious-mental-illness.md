I'm working on a game that tells a story about my experience with my brother's mental illness. Here's a preview:

[Play game here](https://abigpotostew.github.io/shedding/p5/)

#### It's open source:
https://github.com/abigpotostew/shedding


#### Artist's statement:

Shedding (final name TBD) is about acceptance of change. The player interacts with another person that moves in the opposite direction as the player. The other person loses his memories. You can help this person collect memories by both occupying the bordering cells around a memory. ...in progress...

#### Art Cluster
I've been working on this during art cluster sessions with my friend.

#### Updates
###### 6/18/20
It's now in javascript so that I can easily share it with the world!

I'm deciding between making this level design puzzle focused or narrative focused. maybe both?
